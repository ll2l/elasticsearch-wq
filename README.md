elasticsearch-wq
================
A web based elasticsearch query and management tools written in Go.

Overview
========
This is a web-based browser for elasticsearch query/management. Its written in Go and works on Mac OSX, Linux and Windows machines. Main idea behind using Go for the backend is to utilize language's ability for cross-compile source code for multiple platforms. This project is my attempt to learn golang.

## Note
 This is a work in progress. only elasticsearch v6.+ has been tested.
